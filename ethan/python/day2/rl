Analytic Design and Data.: Are the analytical approach adequate and methodology rigorous\n', '           to deal with the research questions? Is data attainable or do statistical techniques\n', '           adequately compensate for data limitation?\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '          Comments:\n', '\n', '          The project proposes three analytical approaches: A cross-country analysis of the effects of\n', '          automation in developed countries on imports sourced from developing countries, a case\n', '          study on the labor market effects of US and domestic automation in Mexico and a simulation\n', '          exercise that combines insights of the two previous approaches.\n', '\n', '          First, the project thus intends to econometrically analyze the impacts of automation on trade\n', '          using cross-country sector-level data on trade flows and the use of robots. In principle, the\n', '          proposed empirical strategy is adequate and the authors also propose some possible (IV)\n', '          strategies to deal with issues of reverse causality and omitted variable bias. As identification\n', '          is not a side issue in the proposed exercise it would have been instructive to be more explicit\n', '          about the IV strategy and potential omitted variables (I am thinking in particular about\n', '          imports from China). The trade data are a standard (and attainable) source and there are\n', '          methods available to deal with the involved challenges (e.g. zero inflation) the authors are\n', '          certainly aware of. The second (but key) data come from the International Federation of\n', '          Robotics (not “Robots”, as in the proposal, … not yet). It would have been very useful if\n', '          some more detail and shortcomings of these data (coverage, time dimension, sectoral\n', '          disaggregation, representativeness) relevant to the proposed exercise had been presented.\n', '          Further, the authors want to use a EU-wide dataset on industrial production (EU-KLEMS)\n', '          for the factoring-in input-output linkages. Here, it remains somewhat unclear whether this\n', '          implies that this type of analysis (but also the use of some of the proposed IV-strategies that\n', '          rely on employment by tasks) would remain restricted to EU-South trade or whether similar\n', '          data can be obtained for other advanced economies/regions. In general, not enough detail\n', '          is provided on how the authors want to integrate input-output linkages in their analysis.\n', '\n', '          Second, the case of Mexico will be subject to an empirical analysis of the local labor market\n', '          impacts of domestic and US automation. The authors propose an approach “in the spirit”\n', '          of Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017) to quantify the effect of the exposure of automation on\n', '          local exports, employmemt and wages. The analysis will be conducted using municipal-level\n', '          trade data and information from economic and population census data (plus, of course,\n', '          information on the use of robots). Although not well described in the proposal the variation\n', '          for identifying the effect of automation on local labour markets (I think) comes from national\n', '          and international data on the use of robots that can be used to compute an “exposure to\n', '          automation” measure based on said employment statistics. Some estimation equation would\n', '          have helped the reader to better understand this. Further, some detail on the data on use of\n', '          robots in Mexico (incidence, sectoral disaggregation and some trends) would have been\n', '          very useful to judge the feasibility of the proposed study. In my view, the authors should have\n', '          addressed some points why the Acemoglu and Restrepo approach may not be very easily\n', '          replicated in the Mexican context. To mention one major challenge: Acemoglu and Restrepo\n', '          (2017) use commuting zones in their analysis, which may be different from the administrative\n', '          zones mentioned in the proposal. I am pretty certain that this will be an issue that the authors\n', '          will have to deal with.\n', '                                                            2\n', '\x0c   Guidelines for Reviewers\n', '\n', '        In a third step, the insights of the former two approaches ought to be combined in a\n', '        “simulation exercise” of different automation and policy scenarios. I am sympathetic to the\n', '        idea of using the obtained results for some indicative scenario analysis. At this stage, this\n', '        section is rather vague albeit some reflections on possible “automation and policy\n', '        scenarios” might have instructive. Further, I would have liked to see, however, some\n', '        mentioning of a (planned) systematic reflection on the external validity of the findings (of\n', '        both studies). This will be required to put the proposed simulation exercises (and, in fact,\n', '        the proposed studies) into context: (1) The studies will only look at the effects of robots in\n', '        industrial activities. While interesting and instructive, in particular for manufacturing\n', '        exporters from the Global South, automation in service sectors will probably have very\n', '        different effects on trade and labour markets. (2) The Mexican case may be peculiar because\n', '        of the (partly) high integration of the firm into US-based value chains. It will be a worthwhile\n', '        exercise to identify places for which the Mexican lessons are particularly worthwhile\n', '        studying.\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '3. Literature. Does the proposal reflect the current knowledge and literature? Does the proposal\n', '   provide convincing rationale for the selection of issues within an overarching topic ? – through an\n', '   overview of the existing body of literature on the subject, identification of priorities for deeper\n', '   understanding, and discussion of analytical problems constraining operations and policy.\n', '\n', '\n', '        Comments:\n', '\n', '        The proposal (mainly in its literature review section) makes references to the relevant\n', '        related strands of literature and, in this sense, it reflects the current knowledge. It does,\n', '        however, a mixed job in explicitly formulating the key research/policy questions, providing\n', '        a corresponding summary of current knowledge and identifying gaps/issues that the\n', '        proposal can (and cannot) address. This is less the case for the literature on the labour\n', '        market impacts of automation (at the beginning of the literature review, section 3). Here,\n', '        the main findings of key studies and the gaps (with regard to developing countries) are well\n', '        described albeit analytical challenges could have received some more attention. The\n', '        references to the two other literature strands on the impacts of automation on trade patterns\n', '        and structural change are fairly superficial. The paragraph on trade pattern is confusing\n', '        and quickly moves to distributional effects (on skill premia). Here, one would have expected\n', '        to see the contribution of the first study being highlighted. In general, the second part of the\n', '        literature review fails to provide key results from the many cited studies and is not able to\n', '        show knowledge gaps. While the proposal could clearly have done a better job in connecting\n', '        the different strands of literature, the overall rationale for the chosen topic is still convincing\n', '        enough.\n', '\n', '        PS: Neither the proposal nor the concept note provide a reference list.

First, it addresses a highly\n', '       relevant topic and can add sound empirical evidence to a policy discussion that – to a\n', '       large extent and in particular with reference to developing countries – relies on\n', '       assumptions. By examining the impacts of automation in a developing country context\n', '       it fills an important gap in an emerging literature. Second, the project is based on a\n', '       sound analytical framework using attainable data and has a clear and feasible\n', '       workplan that will be implemented by an experienced team. Third, the proposed budget\n', '       is plausible and reasonable.\n', '\n', '       The project neatly links KCP’s central “Shared Prosperity” theme with the topical\n', '       focus on “International Cooperation and Global Public Goods”.\n', '\n', '       I have outlined above some weaknesses of the proposal. The analytical part could have\n', '       been more clearly written. This holds in particular for the section on the Mexican case\n', '       study. Then, the data on the usage of robots come with challenges that are not easibly\n', '       addressed. Unfortunately, the proposal does not provide sufficient detail on these data\n', '       and solutions to potential empirical challenges in the specific context of the proposed\n', '       work. I am, however, confident that the team will be able to address the challenges\n', '       when they advance in their project. The literature review fails to synthesize the\n', '       different strands of the literature that are relevant to the project, but the authors are\n', '       able to demonstrate their knowledge of the state of the art.\n', '\n', '       I raise above some concerns regarding the potential policy impact of the project\n', '       despite the fact that the kind of evidence produced will be in high demand. Currently,\n', '       the proposal is fairly focused on generating new academic insights albeit it plans to\n', '       feature them in country strategies, blogs and a conference (with participation of\n', '       “policy-makers”). This is a welcome approach, but the findings may require a better\n', '       link to specific policies and (as stressed above lerady) may need to be put into\n', '       perspective to become policy-relevant.\n', '\n', '       So first, I would like to see some more explicit engagement with possible policy\n', '       responses (conditional on country characteristics and initial conditions). Too often,\n', '       broad policy recommendations in this realm boil down to “identifying and\n', '       compensating losers” and some supply-side labour market measures to help workers\n', '       adjust (“life-long learning” etc.). Here, a more systematic approach that looks into\n', '       policy responses in developing countries, for example to industry reallocations, would\n', '       be useful. Further, some fresh, and maybe unconventional, thinking may be required …\n', '       Can the “new” social protection systems (Mexico a case in point) be used to mitigate\n', '       potential adverse (imported) effects of automation? Are there other policies to deal\n', '       with adjustment and is there a role for trade policy.\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '                                                          7\n', '\x0cGuidelines for Reviewers\n', '\n', '\n', '      Second, let me elaborate a bit more on how the findings need to put into perspective by\n', '      examining a bit more closely a statement made in the proposal, namely that automation\n', '      could “prematurely close the door for labor intensive, export-led growth as a\n', '      development model for inclusive growth”. For interpreting the results of their papers\n', '      with reference to this very important development policy question will require the\n', '      authors to go quite some way, which I wan to illustrate with two important aspects of\n', '      the effects of automation (and there are more). First, there have been – and probably\n', '      will be – very different varities of the “labor intensive, export-led” development model.\n', '      Leaving aside China as a very special case, there are countries that have developed (or\n', '      currently do) an export base in labour-intensive low-tech industries, typically in\n', '      textiles and apparels (Bangaldesh, Vietnam, Cambodia, Mauritius, etc.) that have\n', '      upgraded (or may in the future) to industries with higher valued added and deeper\n', '      integration into global value chains. Then, there are the cases of Mexico and Eastern\n', '      Europe (and some cases in the South-East Asia) where integration started when the\n', '      concerned countries were already at higher income levels, with an important role for\n', '      higher value added industries, often the automotive industry, in a number of cases.\n', '      Probably, automation will have very different implications at the different stages of\n', '      export-led development. Second, this, in turn, has important implications for the\n', '      distributional impacts of automation that is likely to differ between the different\n', '      varieties (or stages) of integration. For example, it is well known that the distributional\n', '      impacts of Mexico’s integration into global value chains were much less favorable than\n', '      anticipated by many.\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '                                                      8\n', '\x0c']
